Hi,

this is a Verilog-AMS 2.3 Parser Frontend. Publicly available Verilog-A and 
Verilog-AMS-2.3 files are preprocessed and parsed correctly. The parse tree 
is internally stored in a VPI-object-tree representation, but no elaboration,
compilation or synthesis is performed. In addition to the parser you find a
simple arbitrary-precision 4-state-Verilog-vector arithmetic implementation
(cf. vec4state.c).

I started working on this some while ago as proof-of-concept. Unfortunately I
will probably not find the required time to continue this project anytime soon.

In the hope that this work may be useful or inspiring to others I nevertheless
release this fragment on SourceForge. Please contact me if you need repository
access, want to take over maintenance and administrator rights for the project
page. Visit the Sourceforge project pages

    http://ovams.sourceforge.net/

                and

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/ovams/

to access the repository. In order to check out code, dependencies, build and
exercise the testbench, type:

    $ git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/ovams/code ovams
    $ cd ovams
    $ make
    $ make check

Best regards, Jack Jost
